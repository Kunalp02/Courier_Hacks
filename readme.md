# Description of Project
The project is of an eCommerce platform. On which person can shop products and can track the orders. They will get the registration notifications, and order confirmation seamlessly by using courier API.


# Inspiration 
Currently, there is a trend of automation in the industry and courier is providing these services easily.



# Problem solved 
Customers get the message asynchronously. They don't have to wait for long. Rather than using celery automation, we can use courier API.
