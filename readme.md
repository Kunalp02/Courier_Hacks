    # Description of Project
    The project is of an eCommerce platform. On which person can shop products and can track the orders. They will get the registration notifications, and order confirmation seamlessly by using courier API.


    # Inspiration 
    Currently, there is a trend of automation in the industry and courier is providing these services easily.



    # Problem solved 
    Customers get the message asynchronously. They don't have to wait for long. Rather than using celery automation, we can use courier API.


    # Tools/ Technologies 
    This Project is built on the Django framework. It uses python language courier API.


    # challenges you faced while building
    None



    # what you enjoyed and learning
    Enjoyed the flow of learning and doing. Learned a lot such as how the Courier API flow is working and about the automation how it gets triggered and how we can set it up.
